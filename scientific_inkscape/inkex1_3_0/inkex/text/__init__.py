"""
This submodule gives all TextElements and FlowRoots the parsed_text property,
which is a cached instance of ParsedText. To use, simply run

    import text

Following this, text properties will be available at el.parsed_text. For more
details, see parser.py. To check if it is working properly, run the
following on some text:

    el.parsed_text.Make_Highlights('char')

Rectangles should appear surrounding the logical extents of each character.

Before parsing is done, a character table must be generated to determine the properties
of all the characters present. This is done automatically by the first invocation of
.parsed_text, which automatically analyzes the whole document and adds it to the SVG.
If you are only parsing a few text elements, this can be sped up by calling
svg.make_char_table(els). On the rare occasions this fails, a command call may
be performed as a fallback.
